# Face-Recognisation

Problem Statement:

The goal is to develop a real-time facial recognition system capable of identifying individuals captured by a webcam. The system must process live video streams, detect faces using Haar cascades, and classify them using the KNN algorithm. Additionally, it should enable the creation and augmentation of a dataset, allowing users to input and save facial features for training and validation purposes.



Dependencies:

OpenCV (cv2): For webcam access, face detection, and image processing.
NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
Haar Cascade XML file: For face detection using pre-trained classifiers
